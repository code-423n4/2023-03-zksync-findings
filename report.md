# Overview

## About C4

Code4rena (C4) is an open organization consisting of security researchers, auditors, developers, and individuals with domain expertise in smart contracts.

A C4 audit is an event in which community participants, referred to as Wardens, review, audit, or analyze smart contract logic in exchange for a bounty provided by sponsoring projects.

During the audit outlined in this document, C4 conducted an analysis of the zkSync Era System Contracts smart contract system written in Solidity. The audit took place between March 10â€”March 19 2023.

## Wardens

19 Wardens contributed reports to the zkSync Era System Contracts audit:

This audit was judged by [Alex the Entreprenerd](https://twitter.com/GalloDaSballo).

Final report assembled by [liveactionllama](https://twitter.com/liveactionllama).

# Summary

The C4 analysis yielded an aggregated total of 6 unique vulnerabilities. Of these vulnerabilities, 1 received a risk rating in the category of HIGH severity and 5 received a risk rating in the category of MEDIUM severity.

Additionally, C4 analysis included 14 reports detailing issues with a risk rating of LOW severity or non-critical.

All of the issues presented here are linked back to their original finding.

*Note: while the [bootloader/bootloader.yul](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-zksync/tree/main/bootloader/bootloader.yul) was out of scope for this audit, the zkSync team decided to reward an additional bounty for valid related vulnerabilities. There were 3 such vulnerabilities found:*

- *[Paymaster context can override a transaction hash in memory](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-zksync-findings/issues/144)*
- *[Bootloader can refund less gas than user paid for L2 tx](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-zksync-findings/issues/54)*
- *[Operator can cause funds to be stolen by manipulating gas fee refund](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-zksync-findings/issues/104)*

# Scope

The code under review can be found within the [C4 zkSync Era System Contracts audit repository](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-zksync), and is composed of 8 libraries, 17 interfaces, 1 abstract, 1 constant, and 13 smart contracts written in the Solidity programming language and includes 2,418 lines of Solidity code.

# Severity Criteria

C4 assesses the severity of disclosed vulnerabilities based on three primary risk categories: high, medium, and low/non-critical.

High-level considerations for vulnerabilities span the following key areas when conducting assessments:

- Malicious Input Handling
- Escalation of privileges
- Arithmetic
- Gas use

For more information regarding the severity criteria referenced throughout the submission review process, please refer to the documentation provided on [the C4 website](https://code4rena.com), specifically our section on [Severity Categorization](https://docs.code4rena.com/awarding/judging-criteria/severity-categorization).

# High Risk Findings (1)
## [[H-01] The call to `MsgValueSimulator` with non zero `msg.value` will call to sender itself which will bypass the `onlySelf` check](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-zksync-findings/issues/153)
*Submitted by [ronnyx2017](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-zksync-findings/issues/153)*

First, I need to clarify, there may be more serious ways to exploit this issue. Due to the lack of time and documents, I cannot complete further exploit. The current exploit has only achieved the impact in the title. I will expand the possibility of further exploit in the poc chapter.

The call to MsgValueSimulator with non zero msg.value will call to sender itself with the msg.data. It means that if you can make a contract or a custom account call to specified address with non zero msg.value (that's very common in withdrawal functions and smart contract wallets), you can make the contract/account call itself. And if you can also control the calldata, you can make the contract/account call its functions by itself.

It will bypass some security check with the msg.sender, or break the accounting logic of some contracts which use the msg.sender as account name.

For example the `onlySelf` modifier in the ContractDepolyer contract:

    modifier onlySelf() {
        require(msg.sender == address(this), "Callable only by self");
        _;
    }

### Proof of Concept

The `MsgValueSimulator` use the `mimicCall` to forward the original call.

    return EfficientCall.mimicCall(gasleft(), to, _data, msg.sender, false, isSystemCall);

And if the `to` address is the `MsgValueSimulator` address, it will go back to the `MsgValueSimulator.fallback` function again.

The fallback function will  Extract the `value` to send, isSystemCall flag and the `to` address from the extraAbi params(r3,r4,r5) in the `_getAbiParams` function. But it's different from the first call to the `MsgValueSimulator`. The account uses `EfficientCall.rawCall` function to call the `MsgValueSimulator.fallback` in the first call. For example, code in `DefaultAccount._execute`:

    bool success = EfficientCall.rawCall(gas, to, value, data);

The rawCall will simulate `system_call_byref` opcode to call the `MsgValueSimulator`. And the `system_call_byref` will write the r3-r5 registers which are read as the above extraAbi params.

But the second call is sent by `EfficientCall.mimicCall`, as the return value explained in the document <https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-zksync/blob/main/docs/VM-specific_v1.3.0_opcodes_simulation.pdf>, `mimicCall` will mess up the registers and will use r1-r4 for standard ABI convention and r5 for the extra who_to_mimic arg. So extraAbi params(r3-r5) read by `_getAbiParams` will be messy data. It can lead to very serious consequences, because the r3 will be used as the msg.value, and the r4 will be used as the `to` address in the final `mimicCall`. It means that the contract will send a different(greater) value to a different address, which is unexpected in the original call.

I really don't know how to write a complex test to verify register changes in the era-compiler-tester. So to find out how to control the registers, I use the repo <https://github.com/matter-labs/zksync-era> and replace the etc/system-contracts/ codes with the lastest version in the audit, and write an integration test.

```
import { TestMaster } from '../src/index';
import * as zksync from 'zksync-web3';
import { BigNumber } from 'ethers';

describe('ETH token checks', () => {
    let testMaster: TestMaster;
    let alice: zksync.Wallet;
    let bob: zksync.Wallet;

    beforeAll(() => {
        testMaster = TestMaster.getInstance(__filename);
        alice = testMaster.mainAccount();
        bob = testMaster.newEmptyAccount();
    });

    test('Can perform a transfer (legacy)', async () => {
        const LEGACY_TX_TYPE = 0;
        const value = BigNumber.from(30000);
        
        const MSG_VALUE_SYSTEM_CONTRACT = "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000008009";
        console.log(await alice.getBalance());
        console.log(await alice.provider.getBalance(MSG_VALUE_SYSTEM_CONTRACT));

        let block = await alice.provider.getBlock("latest");
        console.log("block gas limit", block.gasLimit);
        let tx_gasLimit = block.gasLimit.div(8);
        console.log("tx_gasLimit", tx_gasLimit);
        console.log("gas price", await alice.getGasPrice());

        try {
            let tx = await alice.sendTransaction({ type: LEGACY_TX_TYPE, to: MSG_VALUE_SYSTEM_CONTRACT, value , gasLimit: tx_gasLimit, data: '0x'});
            let txp = await tx.wait();
            console.log("success");
            console.log(txp["logs"]);
        } catch (err ) {
            console.log("fail");
            console.log(err);
            console.log('--------');
            console.log(err["receipt"]["logs"]);
        }
        
        console.log(await alice.getBalance());
        console.log(await alice.provider.getBalance(MSG_VALUE_SYSTEM_CONTRACT));
        console.log(await alice.getNonce());
    });

    afterAll(async () => {
        await testMaster.deinitialize();
    });
});

          }

There are two l2 eth token transaction in addition to gas processing. And the value sent to the `MsgValueSimulator` will stuck in the contract forever.

I found that the r4(to) is always msg.sender, the r5(mask) is always 0x1, and if the length of the calldata is 0, the r3(value) will be `0x2129c0000000a00000000`, and if the length > 0, r3(value) will be `0x215800000000a00000000 + calldata.length << 96`. So in this case, the balance of the sender should be at least 0x2129c0000000a00000000 wei to finish the whole transaction whitout reverting.

I did not find any document about the `standard ABI convention` mentioned in the VM-specific_v1.3.0\_opcodes_simulation.pdf and the r5 is also not really the extra who\_to\_mimic arg. I didn't make a more serious exploit due to lack of time. I'd like more documentation about register call conventions to verify the possibility of manipulating registers.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Check the `to` address in the `MsgValueSimulator` contract.  The `to` address must not be the `MsgValueSimulator` address.

# Medium Risk Findings (5)
## [[M-01] deploying contracts with `forceDeployOnAddress` will break contracts when `callConstructor` is false](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-zksync-findings/issues/167)
*Submitted by [unforgiven](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-zksync-findings/issues/167), also found by [Franfran](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-zksync-findings/issues/171), [bin2chen](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-zksync-findings/issues/92), [HE1M](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-zksync-findings/issues/86), and [rvierdiiev](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-zksync-findings/issues/12)*

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-zksync/blob/21d9a364a4a75adfa6f1e038232d8c0f39858a64/contracts/ContractDeployer.sol#L212-L227><br>
<https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-zksync/blob/21d9a364a4a75adfa6f1e038232d8c0f39858a64/contracts/ContractDeployer.sol#L302-L306>

When function `forceDeployOnAddress()` used for deploying contract and `callConstructor` is false, then contract's bytecodehash would stay in constructing state and calling the contract won't be possible. it can cause protocol and other contracts that are using it to break and if they call that address and sends some funds, then those funds would be lost. the issue is critical because the updated contract(which is updated by calling `forceDeployOnAddress()`) can be part of important process like bridging or sending messages or withdrawing funds.

### Proof of Concept

This is `forceDeployOnAddress()` code in ContractDeployer:

```solidity
    /// @notice The method that can be used to forcefully deploy a contract.
    /// @param _deployment Information about the forced deployment.
    /// @param _sender The `msg.sender` inside the constructor call.
    function forceDeployOnAddress(ForceDeployment calldata _deployment, address _sender) external payable onlySelf {
        _ensureBytecodeIsKnown(_deployment.bytecodeHash);
        _storeConstructingByteCodeHashOnAddress(_deployment.newAddress, _deployment.bytecodeHash);

        AccountInfo memory newAccountInfo;
        newAccountInfo.supportedAAVersion = AccountAbstractionVersion.None;
        // Accounts have sequential nonces by default.
        newAccountInfo.nonceOrdering = AccountNonceOrdering.Sequential;
        _storeAccountInfo(_deployment.newAddress, newAccountInfo);

        if (_deployment.callConstructor) {
            _constructContract(_sender, _deployment.newAddress, _deployment.input, false);
        }

        emit ContractDeployed(_sender, _deployment.bytecodeHash, _deployment.newAddress);
    }
```

As you can see in the second line code calls `_storeConstructingByteCodeHashOnAddress()` and it would set constructing bytecode hash the address(the second byte is 1), and when `_deployment.callConstructor` is false, code won't call `_constructContract()` (which sets the address's bytecode hash as constructed after calling constructor) and contract bytecode hash would stay in constructing state after the deployment.

The constructing bytecode state is there to prevent other contracts to call this contract when this contract's constructor is called. Constructing state means that "if anyone else call the contract, it will behaves like a contract being constructing (EmptyContract/EOA)". so contract won't be callable if it stays in the Constructing state. This can cause serious issues, like this scenario:

If important contracts like L1Messenger, L2EthToken, MsgValueSimulator, ... needed upgrade and their code upgraded with this deployer function(and admin didn't want to call constructor as initiating the contract again would break it), then the contract logics won't be callable by others but it would still behave like EmptyContract, the transaction won't revert and other contracts logics won't get interrupted but they don't work properly, for example user would spend funds(send to the updated contract) but because logics won't get executed the funds would be lost.

The real impact may be different based on the target contract that is being deployed by this function(when `callConstructor`=false), but in each time the contract deployment would break the contract and deployment would be faulted. the issue can happen every time and using this function to upgrade system contracts without calling constructor is common. for example imagine there is a contract, that have constructor that initialize the state. It is supposed to be called only once, for the first deployment. But protocol want to redeploy contract, that state of the contract is the same as before force deployment. So they want to skip the constructing phrase.

### Tools Used

VIM

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Even when `callConstructor` is false, and code doesn't call the constructor, code should set the address's bytecode hash to Constructed state after the deployment.

## [[M-02] User transactions can call system contracts directly](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-zksync-findings/issues/146)
*Submitted by [Jeiwan](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-zksync-findings/issues/146), also found by [ronnyx2017](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-zksync-findings/issues/152)*

User transaction can call system contracts directly, which shouldn't be allowed to not invoke potentially dangerous operations.

### Proof of Concept

The [DefaultAccount.executeTransaction](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-zksync/blob/21d9a364a4a75adfa6f1e038232d8c0f39858a64/contracts/DefaultAccount.sol#L117) executes a user transaction after it was validated. The function calls [\_execute](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-zksync/blob/21d9a364a4a75adfa6f1e038232d8c0f39858a64/contracts/DefaultAccount.sol#L140) under the hood. The `_execute` function makes two different calls depending on the destination address of a transaction:

1.  if the `ContractDeployer` is called, it'll [pass the call to the contract](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-zksync/blob/21d9a364a4a75adfa6f1e038232d8c0f39858a64/contracts/DefaultAccount.sol#L149) via the system call (`ContractDeployer` is a system contract and can be executed only via system calls);
2.  if any other contract is called, it'll [execute the call via `EfficientCall.rawCall`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-zksync/blob/21d9a364a4a75adfa6f1e038232d8c0f39858a64/contracts/DefaultAccount.sol#L151).

`EfficientCall.rawCall` in its turn also makes two different calls:

1.  If `msg.value` of the transaction is 0, it'll [make a regular call](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-zksync/blob/21d9a364a4a75adfa6f1e038232d8c0f39858a64/contracts/libraries/EfficientCall.sol#L131).
2.  If there's some ETH sent with the transaction (i.e. `msg.value` is positive), it'll [pass the call to the `MsgValueSimulator` contract](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-zksync/blob/21d9a364a4a75adfa6f1e038232d8c0f39858a64/contracts/libraries/EfficientCall.sol#L144). `MsgValueSimulator` is a system contract, thus the `isSystem` flag will be set in the far call ABI (notice the `true` in the [last argument of `_loadFarCallABIIntoActivePtr`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-zksync/blob/21d9a364a4a75adfa6f1e038232d8c0f39858a64/contracts/libraries/EfficientCall.sol#L134)). However, it'll also [set the forward mask](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-zksync/blob/21d9a364a4a75adfa6f1e038232d8c0f39858a64/contracts/libraries/EfficientCall.sol#L141) to 1 (the value of [MSG\_VALUE\_SIMULATOR\_IS\_SYSTEM\_BIT](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-zksync/blob/21d9a364a4a75adfa6f1e038232d8c0f39858a64/contracts/Constants.sol#L71)). `MsgValueSimulator` will [extract the mask and will set the `isSystemCall` flag to true](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-zksync/blob/21d9a364a4a75adfa6f1e038232d8c0f39858a64/contracts/MsgValueSimulator.sol#L27)â€“it'll then pass the `isSystemCall` flag to the [subsequent call](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-zksync/blob/21d9a364a4a75adfa6f1e038232d8c0f39858a64/contracts/MsgValueSimulator.sol#L62), making the call a system one.

To sum it up, if a transaction calls a contract that's not `ContractDeployer` and sends ETH, the call will be a system one, which will let it call the system contracts. However, users shouldn't be allowed to call system contracts directly to not invoke potentially dangerous operations. As per the documentation:

> Some of the system contracts can act on behalf of the user or have a very important impact on the behavior of the account. That's why we wanted to make it clear that users can not invoke potentially dangerous operations by doing a simple EVM-like call. Whenever a user wants to invoke some of the operations which we considered dangerous, they must explicitly provide isSystem flag with them.

However, since most system contracts are harmless, there's no direct high severity impact on the system, thus I think the issue is a medium severity.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

In the `EfficientCall.rawCall` function, consider setting the forward mask to 0. The behaviour of the function is similar to that of the `msgValueSimulatorMimicCall` function from the bootloader:

1.  since the `MsgValueSimulator` contract is called, the `isSystemCall` flag should be set [only for this call](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-zksync/blob/21d9a364a4a75adfa6f1e038232d8c0f39858a64/bootloader/bootloader.yul#L1737);
2.  the `isSystemCall` flag should be forwarded by `MsgValueSimulator` [only if the destination contract is `ContractDeployer`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-zksync/blob/21d9a364a4a75adfa6f1e038232d8c0f39858a64/bootloader/bootloader.yul#L1730).

It looks that the second part of the `EfficientCall.rawCall` function was copied from the `SystemContractsCaller.systemCall` function, which is intended to call system contracts and which sets the forward mask to 1 when calling `MsgValueSimulator`. However, `rawCall` shouldn't forward the `isSystemCall` flag.

## [[M-03] `DefaultAccount#fallback` lack payable](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-zksync-findings/issues/93)
*Submitted by [bin2chen](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-zksync-findings/issues/93), also found by [minaminao](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-zksync-findings/issues/87)*

Fallback lack `payable`,will lead to differences from the mainnet, and many existing protocols may not work.

### Proof of Concept

DefaultAccount Defined as follows:

    DefaultAccount

    The implementation of the default account abstraction. This is the code that is used by default for all addresses that are not in kernel space and have no contract deployed on them. This address:

    Contains the minimal implementation of our account abstraction protocol. Note that it supports the built-in paymaster flows.
    When anyone (except bootloader) calls/delegate calls it, it behaves in the same way as a call to an EOA, i.e. it always returns success = 1, returndatasize = 0 for calls from anyone except for the bootloader.

If there is no code for the address, the DefaultAccount `#fallback` method will be executed, which is compatible with the behavior of the mainnet.

But at present, `fallback` is not `payable`.<br>
The code is as follows

```solidity
contract DefaultAccount is IAccount {
    using TransactionHelper for *;
..
    fallback() external { //<--------without payable
        // fallback of default account shouldn't be called by bootloader under no circumstances
        assert(msg.sender != BOOTLOADER_FORMAL_ADDRESS);

        // If the contract is called directly, behave like an EOA
    }

    receive() external payable {
        // If the contract is called directly, behave like an EOA
    }

```

Which will lead to differences from the mainnet.

For example, the mainnet execution of the method with value will return true, and the corresponding value will be transfer but DefaultAccount.sol will return false.

It is quite common for `call ()` to with `value`. If it is not compatible, many existing protocols may not work.

Mainnet code example, executing 0x0 call with value can be successful:

```solidity
  function test() external {
    vm.deal(address(this),1000);
    console.log("before value:",address(0x0).balance);
    (bool result,bytes memory datas) = address(0x0).call{value:10}("abc");
    console.log("call result:",result);
    console.log("after value:",address(0x0).balance);
  }
```

```console
$ forge test -vvv

[PASS] test() (gas: 42361)
Logs:
  before value: 0
  call result: true
  after value: 10
```

Simulate DefaultAccount `#fallback` without payable, it will fail:

```solidity

    contract DefaultAccount {
        fallback() external {     
        }
        receive() external payable {      
        }
    }

    function test() external {
        DefaultAccount defaultAccount = new DefaultAccount();
        vm.deal(address(this),1000);
        console.log("before value:",address(defaultAccount).balance);
        (bool result,bytes memory datas) = address(defaultAccount).call{value:10}("abc");
        console.log("call result:",result);
        console.log("after value:",address(defaultAccount).balance);
    }
```

```console
$ forge test -vvv

[PASS] test() (gas: 62533)
Logs:
  before value: 0
  call result: false
  after value: 0
```

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

```solidity
- function test() external {
+ function test() external payable {
    vm.deal(address(this),1000);
    console.log("before value:",address(0x0).balance);
    (bool result,bytes memory datas) = address(0x0).call{value:10}("abc");
    console.log("call result:",result);
    console.log("after value:",address(0x0).balance);
  }
```

## [[M-04] Time-sensitive contracts deployed on zkSync](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-zksync-findings/issues/70)
*Submitted by [HE1M](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-zksync-findings/issues/70), also found by [minaminao](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-zksync-findings/issues/31), [rvierdiiev](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-zksync-findings/issues/24), and [0x73696d616f](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-zksync-findings/issues/11)*

Time-sensitive contracts will be impacted if deployed on zkSync.

### Proof of Concept

Many contracts use `block.number` to measure the time as the miners were able to manipulate the `timestamp` (the `timestamp` could be easily gamed over short intervals). So, it was assumed that `block.number` is a safer and more accurate source of measuring time than `timestamp`.

For instance, if a defi project sets 144000 block interval to release the interest, it means approximately `144000 * 12 = 20 days`. Please note that each block in Ethereum takes almost 12 second.

If the same defi project is deployed on zkSync, it will not operate as expected. Because there is no time-bound for the blocks in zkSync (the interval may be 30 seconds or 1 week). So, the time to release the interest can be between 50 days to 2762 days.

Since, it is assumed that zkSync is Ethereum compatible, any deployed contracts on Ethereum may deploy their contract in zkSync without noting such big difference.

Even if the contracts use `timestamp` to measure the time, there will be another issue. In the contract `SystemContext.sol`, it is possible to set new block with the same `timestamp` as previous block, but with incremented block number.<br>
<https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-zksync/blob/21d9a364a4a75adfa6f1e038232d8c0f39858a64/contracts/SystemContext.sol#L116>

In other words, new blocks are created but their time is frozen. Please note that freezing time can not be lasted for a long time, because when committing block their `timestamp` will be validated against a defined boundary.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

It should be explicitly mentioned that block intervals in zkSync are not compatible with Ethereum. So, time-sensitive contracts will be noted.

Moreover, the equal sign should be removed in the following line:<br>
<https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-zksync/blob/21d9a364a4a75adfa6f1e038232d8c0f39858a64/contracts/SystemContext.sol#L116>

## [[M-05] Losing fund during force deployment](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-zksync-findings/issues/64)
*Submitted by [HE1M](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-zksync-findings/issues/64)*

During force deployment, if the fund is not properly transferred to the to-be-force-deployed contract, the fund will remain in the contract `ContractDeployer` and can not easily be recovered.

### Proof of Concept

The function `forceDeployOnAddresses` in contract `ContractDeployer` is used only during an upgrade to set bytecodes on specific addresses.<br>
<https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-zksync/blob/21d9a364a4a75adfa6f1e038232d8c0f39858a64/contracts/ContractDeployer.sol#L232>

The ETH sent to this function will be used to initialize to-be-force-deployed contracts. The ETH sent should be equal to the aggregated value needed for each contract.<br>
<https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-zksync/blob/21d9a364a4a75adfa6f1e038232d8c0f39858a64/contracts/ContractDeployer.sol#L240>

Then the function externally calls itself, and send the required value to itself.<br>
<https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-zksync/blob/21d9a364a4a75adfa6f1e038232d8c0f39858a64/contracts/ContractDeployer.sol#L245>

If any of this call is unsuccessful, the whole transaction will not revert, and the loop continues to deploy all the contract on the provided `newAddress`.

If for any reason, the deployment was not successful, the transferred ETH will remain in `ContractDeployer`, and can not be used for the next deployments (because the aggregated amount is compared with `msg.value` not the ETH balance of the contract). In other words, `FORCE_DEPLOYER` fund will be in `ContractDeployer`, and it can not be easily recoverred.

The possibility of unsuccessful deployment is not low:

It can happen if the bytecode is not known already.<br>
<https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-zksync/blob/21d9a364a4a75adfa6f1e038232d8c0f39858a64/contracts/ContractDeployer.sol#L213><br>
<https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-zksync/blob/21d9a364a4a75adfa6f1e038232d8c0f39858a64/contracts/ContractDeployer.sol#L296>

It can happen during storing constructing bytecode hash.<br>
<https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-zksync/blob/21d9a364a4a75adfa6f1e038232d8c0f39858a64/contracts/ContractDeployer.sol#L214><br>
<https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-zksync/blob/21d9a364a4a75adfa6f1e038232d8c0f39858a64/contracts/AccountCodeStorage.sol#L36>

It can happen during constructing contract and transferring the value.<br>
<https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-zksync/blob/21d9a364a4a75adfa6f1e038232d8c0f39858a64/contracts/ContractDeployer.sol#L223>

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

By using try/catch, the fund can be transferred to an address that the governor has control to be used later.

    function forceDeployOnAddresses(ForceDeployment[] calldata _deployments)
            external
            payable
        {
            // remaining of the code

            for (uint256 i = 0; i < deploymentsLength; ++i) {
                try
                    this.forceDeployOnAddress{value: _deployments[i].value}(
                        _deployments[i],
                        msg.sender
                    )
                {} catch {
                    ETH_TOKEN_SYSTEM_CONTRACT.transferFromTo(
                        address(this),
                        SomeAddress,
                        _deployments[i].value
                    );
                }
            }
        }

    /// @notice Set the current tx origin.
    /// @param _gasPrice The new tx gasPrice.
    function setGasPrice(uint256 _gasPrice) external onlyBootloader {
        gasPrice = _gasPrice;
    }
```

## [3]
In functions `unsafeOverrideBlock()` and `setNewBlock()` of SystemContext, code should check that timestamp  is less than `BLOCK_INFO_BLOCK_NUMBER_PART`, otherwise it can overflow and change the block number when combining them to calculate block info.
```solidity
        // Setting new block number and timestamp
        currentBlockInfo = (currentBlockNumber + 1) * BLOCK_INFO_BLOCK_NUMBER_PART + _newTimestamp;


        currentBlockInfo = (number) * BLOCK_INFO_BLOCK_NUMBER_PART + _newTimestamp;
```

Function `BytecodeCompressor.publishCompressedBytecode()` shouldn't be payable as it doesn't have any logic for transferred ETH. If users send eth by mistake their funds would be lost.
```solidity
    function publishCompressedBytecode(
        bytes calldata _bytecode,
        bytes calldata _rawCompressedData
    ) external payable returns (bytes32 bytecodeHash) {
```

## [5]
Function `BytecodeCompressor.publishCompressedBytecode()` should check that the bytecode doesn't published before, it's possible to publish multiple compressed format for single bytecodes which can create issue for indexers and 3rd parties. If a bytecode has published before it's not necessary to publish it again. Also user or other protocol contract may lose funds if it calls this publish multiple times by mistake.<br>

## [6]
The check for system deployer address in `DefaultAccount._validateTransaction()` is not correct as it convert `DEPLOYER_SYSTEM_CONTRACT` to uint256 and compare it to the `_transaction.to`. If `_transaction.to` was equal to `2^180 + DEPLOYER_SYSTEM_CONTRACT` then the check would be bypassed but the target address is in fact `DEPLOYER_SYSTEM_CONTRACT`. Code should convert `_transaction.to` to address and then check it with `DEPLOYER_SYSTEM_CONTRACT`.
```solidity
        if (_transaction.to == uint256(uint160(address(DEPLOYER_SYSTEM_CONTRACT)))) {
            require(_transaction.data.length >= 4, "Invalid call to ContractDeployer");
        }
```

## [7]
Code of `AccountCodeStorage.getCodeHash()` and `AccountCodeStorage.getCodeSize()` would return wrong values for inputs that are larger than `2^161-1` because code convert the input to uint160 and then return value for that address so if the input was bigger than max value of the uint160 then it when casting happens the calculated address can belong to another contract address. For example, there return value for `2^161 + Contract1_Address` will be the `Contract1_Address` information while there is no contract in `2^161 + Contract1_Address`. Code should make sure that the input uint256 is less than `2^161`.
```solidity
    function getCodeSize(uint256 _input) external view override returns (uint256 codeSize) {
        // We consider the account bytecode size of the last 20 bytes of the input, because
        // according to the spec "If EXTCODESIZE of A is X, then EXTCODESIZE of A + 2**160 is X".
        address account = address(uint160(_input));
        bytes32 codeHash = getRawCodeHash(account);
....
....
    function getCodeHash(uint256 _input) external view override returns (bytes32) {
        // We consider the account bytecode hash of the last 20 bytes of the input, because
        // according to the spec "If EXTCODEHASH of A is X, then EXTCODEHASH of A + 2**160 is X".
        address account = address(uint160(_input));
        if (uint160(account) <= CURRENT_MAX_PRECOMPILE_ADDRESS) {
            return EMPTY_STRING_KECCAK;
        }
....
....
```

## [8]
Function `TransactionHelper.isEthToken()` should convert the input to the address and compare it to the `ETH_TOKEN_SYSTEM_CONTRACT`, in current implementation value `2^161 + ETH_TOKEN_SYSTEM_CONTRACT` would be not considered as ethToken but when it is converted to the uint160 and address it would be as `ETH_TOKEN_SYSTEM_CONTRACT`. Any logic depending on this function's return value can be vulnerable as it would be possible to supply uint256(Input1) that bypass `!isEthToken(Input1)` check but in fact the uint160(input1) is ETH token.
```solidity
    function isEthToken(uint256 _addr) internal pure returns (bool) {
        return _addr == uint256(uint160(address(ETH_TOKEN_SYSTEM_CONTRACT))) || _addr == 0;
    }
```
