This is my first audit & contest, ever. I'm extremely junior level still. So if the below is rubbish, please forgive me.

I decided to focus only on the bootloader.yul file.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

Pointer and memory management:
Ensure proper initialization and null value checks, use pointer arithmetic cautiously, validate user input, and allocate and release memory properly. Additionally, consider using a memory-safe language or library to avoid these types of vulnerabilities altogether.

Reentrancy attacks:
To prevent reentrancy attacks, consider moving the ether transfer to the end of the ensurePayment function, after all internal state updates have been made. Alternatively, use the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern to ensure that all state changes are made before any external interactions.

Insufficient validation:
To prevent financial losses due to insufficient validation, perform adequate checks to validate all user input, including the gasPerPubdata and userProvidedPubdataPrice parameters. Ensure that all input values are properly validated and formatted before being used in calculations or updates.

Function visibility specifier:
Explicitly define the visibility of all functions to avoid unintended behavior. Consider making functions that are only used internally private, and those that may be called externally public.

Caller authorization:
Ensure that only authorized callers can perform sensitive functions such as minting ETH. Consider implementing a permission system or access control list to restrict access to these functions.

L1 transaction validity:
Before processing an L1 transaction, perform proper validation to ensure that the transaction data is valid and not malicious. Consider using a library or built-in function to validate transaction data.

Untrusted input:
Validate all input values, including innerTxDataOffset, transactionIndex, gasPerPubdata, intrinsicGas, and intrinsicPubdata, to prevent attackers from manipulating the behavior of the contract. Use strict data typing and format validation to ensure that input values are properly formatted and within expected ranges.

-ensurePayment() > null value checks?
-Reentrancy?: The function ensurePayment sends ether to an address before performing any internal state updates. This can lead to reentrancy attacks if the address's fallback function invokes another function that can change the internal state.

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-zksync/blob/21d9a364a4a75adfa6f1e038232d8c0f39858a64/bootloader/bootloader.yul#L629

-Insufficient validation?: The function processTx does not perform adequate checks to validate the gasPerPubdata and userProvidedPubdataPrice parameters, which could result in financial losses.
There is a potential issue with the processTx function in terms of validating the gasPerPubdata and userProvidedPubdataPrice parameters. The validateUint32 function is used to check if gasPerPubdataByteLimitValue is a valid uint32 value, but there is no validation performed on the userProvidedPubdataPrice parameter.
Additionally, the code only checks if the userProvidedPubdataPrice is less than the gasPerPubdata, but it should also be checked if the userProvidedPubdataPrice is a valid uint32 value.

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-zksync/blob/21d9a364a4a75adfa6f1e038232d8c0f39858a64/bootloader/bootloader.yul#L707

-No function visibility specifier: In Yul default visibility is internal. The visibility of some functions such as processTx, lengthRoundedByWords, ensurePayment, and getCanonicalL1TxHash is not explicitly defined, which can lead to unintended behavior.

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-zksync/blob/21d9a364a4a75adfa6f1e038232d8c0f39858a64/bootloader/bootloader.yul#L791

-mintEther() function:
The function mintEther does not seem to check whether the caller is authorized to mint ETH to the recipient. It is assumed that the caller has the appropriate permissions. If this is not the case, it could allow an attacker to mint ETH to an unauthorized address.

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-zksync/blob/21d9a364a4a75adfa6f1e038232d8c0f39858a64/bootloader/bootloader.yul#L892

-processL1Tx() function:
Regarding L1 transaction validity before processing it. The current implementation does not perform any validation of the transaction data before processing it

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-zksync/blob/21d9a364a4a75adfa6f1e038232d8c0f39858a64/bootloader/bootloader.yul#L822

-storePaymasterContextAndCheckMagic() function:
The storePaymasterContextAndCheckMagic() function should be modified to ensure that the returned context data from the paymaster is properly formatted and not malicious. Currently, the function does not perform any validation of the context data, which could allow an attacker to craft a malicious context that could cause the contract to enter an invalid state.

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-zksync/blob/21d9a364a4a75adfa6f1e038232d8c0f39858a64/bootloader/bootloader.yul#L1116

-Untrusted input: The getGasLimitForTx function takes several inputs, including innerTxDataOffset, transactionIndex, gasPerPubdata, intrinsicGas, and intrinsicPubdata, which are assumed to be trusted. However, if these inputs are not properly validated, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to manipulate the behavior of the contract.

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-zksync/blob/21d9a364a4a75adfa6f1e038232d8c0f39858a64/bootloader/bootloader.yul#L1065

-Gas limit and price: The processL2Tx function takes a gas limit and price as inputs and assumes that the transaction can be executed within those limits. However, this may not always be the case, and it is important to ensure that the gas limit and price are set appropriately to avoid running out of gas or paying too much for gas.

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-zksync/blob/21d9a364a4a75adfa6f1e038232d8c0f39858a64/bootloader/bootloader.yul#L3196

-Misuse of assertionError - The assertionError function is used to indicate an invalid republish, but it is not clear what exactly constitutes an invalid republish. As such, it is possible that this function can be used to trigger arbitrary failures in the system.
-In function assertionError, the err parameter should be checked to ensure that it is a valid string. If it is not a string, then the function could behave unexpectedly, leading to potential vulnerabilities.

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-zksync/blob/21d9a364a4a75adfa6f1e038232d8c0f39858a64/bootloader/bootloader.yul#L1597

-The ZKSYNC_NEAR_CALL_executeL1Tx function assumes that addresses of smart contracts on zkSync and Ethereum never overlap, so it does not check whether the from address is an externally owned account (EOA) or a smart contract. This assumption could be false, which could lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities. It is recommended to add a check to make sure that the from address is an EOA before proceeding with the transaction.
-Reentrancy vulnerability: The ZKSYNC_NEAR_CALL_executeL1Tx function calls the executeL1Tx function, which is an external function that could potentially be reentrant. If executeL1Tx is reentrant, it could be called again before the first call has completed, which could result in unexpected behavior or a loss of funds.
-Gas price manipulation: The ZKSYNC_NEAR_CALL_executeL1Tx function sets the gas price using the setGasPrice function. If an attacker were able to manipulate the gas price, they could potentially cause the function to consume more gas than expected, resulting in a denial-of-service attack.

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-zksync/blob/21d9a364a4a75adfa6f1e038232d8c0f39858a64/bootloader/bootloader.yul#L1563

-Data validation: The getVerifiedOperatorOverheadForTx function does not appear to perform any validation on its inputs, which could potentially result in unexpected behavior if the inputs are malformed or invalid.

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-zksync/blob/21d9a364a4a75adfa6f1e038232d8c0f39858a64/bootloader/bootloader.yul#L1669

-The ZKSYNC_NEAR_CALL_ethCall function does not appear to validate the ABI input to ensure that it is well-formed or corresponds to a valid contract function, which could potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause unexpected behavior. This lack of input validation could be a vulnerability.

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-zksync/blob/21d9a364a4a75adfa6f1e038232d8c0f39858a64/bootloader/bootloader.yul#L1795

-In function getTransactionUpfrontOverhead(), there is no input validation or sanitization. For example, txGasLimit should be checked to ensure it's a valid number, and not less than or equal to zero. This vulnerability can lead to the invalid result or unexpected execution.
Additionally, there is no check to ensure that gasPerPubdataByte is not equal to zero, which could cause division by zero. This issue should be handled by adding a check to ensure gasPerPubdataByte is not equal to zero. 
In the getTransactionUpfrontOverhead function, the line ceilDiv(safeMul(totalBlockOverhead, txGasLimit, "ac"),MAX_GAS_PER_TRANSACTION()) can be problematic because MAX_GAS_PER_TRANSACTION() can be zero, leading to a division-by-zero error. To address this, the code checks for a zero value of gasPerPubdataByte and, if found, it calls assertionError function which will throw an exception.

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-zksync/blob/21d9a364a4a75adfa6f1e038232d8c0f39858a64/bootloader/bootloader.yul#L1858

-In function prependSelector(), the function uses sub(txDataOffset, 4) to calculate calldataPtr. It is not clear whether txDataOffset is always greater than or equal to 4. If txDataOffset is less than 4, this could cause an out-of-bounds memory access. It is recommended to add input validation to ensure that txDataOffset is at least 4.

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-zksync/blob/21d9a364a4a75adfa6f1e038232d8c0f39858a64/bootloader/bootloader.yul#L2016

-saveTxHashes(): Potential vulnerability: The saveTxHashes() function can be called multiple times within a single transaction, which can result in overwriting the transaction hash and suggested signed hash, potentially allowing an attacker to exploit the overwritten data.
Additionally, the code appears to be missing a check to validate whether the input parameter txDataOffset passed to saveTxHashes() is a valid memory offset before it is processed. If txDataOffset is an invalid offset, the function could cause a crash or other issues.

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-zksync/blob/21d9a364a4a75adfa6f1e038232d8c0f39858a64/bootloader/bootloader.yul#L2058

-In ZKSYNC_NEAR_CALL_callPostOp(), the maximum amount of refunded gas that the bootloader can receive is hardcoded. This value may not be appropriate for all transactions and could potentially be exploited by an attacker.

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-zksync/blob/21d9a364a4a75adfa6f1e038232d8c0f39858a64/bootloader/bootloader.yul#L2407

-The sendToL1 function has insufficient checks on the parameters passed to it. Specifically, the key and value parameters are not validated or sanitized, which could potentially lead to injection attacks.

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-zksync/blob/21d9a364a4a75adfa6f1e038232d8c0f39858a64/bootloader/bootloader.yul#L2289
https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-zksync/blob/21d9a364a4a75adfa6f1e038232d8c0f39858a64/bootloader/bootloader.yul#L2313

-Reentrancy vulnerability: The executeL1Tx and executeL2Tx functions do not check if they are being called from an already running invocation. An attacker could use this to execute the same function again before the previous invocation is finished, causing unexpected behavior or modifying data in ways that the contract did not expect.

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-zksync/blob/21d9a364a4a75adfa6f1e038232d8c0f39858a64/bootloader/bootloader.yul#L2336

-Integer overflow: The getFarCallABI function has an integer overflow vulnerability. If the gasPassed argument exceeds 2^64 - 1, the value will wrap around, potentially causing the call to use less gas than intended.

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-zksync/blob/21d9a364a4a75adfa6f1e038232d8c0f39858a64/bootloader/bootloader.yul#L2394

-Unbounded recursion: There is a possibility of unbounded recursion in the getWordByte function, which could be abused to consume all gas and cause the transaction to revert.
The getWordByte function could potentially cause unbounded recursion if byteIdx is greater than 31 or negative, which could result in the contract running out of gas and the transaction being reverted. It may be a good idea to add a check to ensure that byteIdx is within the acceptable range before executing the rest of the function.

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-zksync/blob/21d9a364a4a75adfa6f1e038232d8c0f39858a64/bootloader/bootloader.yul#L2810

-The validateAbiEncoding function assumes that the transaction data is tightly packed and does not validate this assumption. If the data is not tightly packed, the function may read data incorrectly or fail to function correctly. It is important to validate assumptions about the data to ensure that the contract operates as expected.

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-zksync/blob/21d9a364a4a75adfa6f1e038232d8c0f39858a64/bootloader/bootloader.yul#L3071

-The askOperatorForRefund function is used to request a refund from the operator and store the expected refund in memory. The function does not provide a parameter to indicate which operator to request the refund from, which could be a potential vulnerability if multiple operators are involved.
Additionally, the gasLeft parameter is not declared as a uint256 type, and it does not validate the gasLeft parameter. It should be explicitly declared to ensure that the function only accepts valid input. Additionally, it may be useful to check that the function is only called by authorized parties.
